## Key Decisions

- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time updates for presence and conversations
- **Aesthetic**: Severance meets fantasy tavern - clean, minimal, mysterious, warm
- **No streaming**: Focus on interaction layer only
- **Anonymous first**: Session-based identity, optional accounts later
- **SVG rendering**: Using SVG for grid, nodes, and user glyphs

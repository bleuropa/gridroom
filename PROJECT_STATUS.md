- (none yet)

## Next Up (Top 3 Priorities)

1. Implement infinite pannable grid canvas
2. Add user presence as abstract glyphs/shapes
3. Create topic nodes and conversation rooms

---

## Open Questions / Blockers

- Canvas vs SVG for grid rendering?
- Anonymous-first or optional accounts from start?
- Sound design: ambient audio on by default?

---

## Key Decisions

- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time updates for presence and conversations
- **Aesthetic**: Severance meets fantasy tavern - clean, minimal, mysterious, warm
- **No streaming**: Unlike BunkerOverlay, we focus on interaction layer only
- **Anonymous first**: Session-based identity, optional accounts later
